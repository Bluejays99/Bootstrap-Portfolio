            <h2>About Me</h2>

           <p>Hello, my name is Chris Minassian.  I am in my thirties, 2 days away from my birthday, I just got married last year and my wife and I are expecting our first baby at the end of this month (June 2019). 
            
           <p>We don't want to know if the baby is a girl or boy and are super excited.  Additonally, I'm a mental health therapist that works for a school and I also work in private practice.  I've been practicing as a therapist for 9 years and have used several modalities including solution-focused, narrative, and cognitive behavioral therapy.  Finally, I'm a big sports fan and an avid comics collector.  I watch every sport, because I grew up watching and play all kinds of sports, and as far as the comic books, well I have started to collect some of the most expensive and rare comics that have Marvel legend Stan Lee's autograph.  Come and check out my website and you'll find it fun and interesting, thanks for stopping by!!</p>
